Using chosen API from https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis create React app with context.

App should provide API data that is transformed in some way.

Depending on API create dynamic sub routes for chosen item from the provided list.

Preliminary data flow:
API request -> data transformation (removing keys/counting/linking with other objects) -> providing data -> consuming data -> displaying data
                                                                                                                -> additional dynamic route for selected item

For dynamic routes refer to: https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks/useparams
For local code implementation: https://github.com/Simofy/fe2-7/blob/main/src/lesson-12/Task1/PreviewItem.jsx
